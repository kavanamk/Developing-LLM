PyTorch provides a function index_select which enables us to select some elements from a tensor with indices.

At first, we need to create a tensor (Long type) that indicates the indices we want to select. Since we want to use index to locate the element in a tensor, this tensor must be of Long type.

index_select requires the following parameters:

The first parameter is the tensor we want to select.
dim: It indicates the dimension in which we index. In this example, the tensor is a 2-dimensions tensor. dim=0 means the row, dim=1 means the column.
index: The 1-D tensor containing the indices to index.


import torch

a = torch.arange(1, 10).reshape((3, 3))

indices = torch.LongTensor([0, 2])
result = torch.index_select(a, dim=0, index=indices)
print(result)

Output

tensor([[1, 2, 3],
        [7, 8, 9]])
